# Docker CV + cover letter: working environment setup 

In this repository, I proposed to build a Docker image including LaTeX and moderncv for preparing your CV and cover letter (or any reports).

You can add or remove some installation processes indicated in the file ``Dockerfile`` in order to customize your docker image as your needs.

Once you're ready to build your Docker image, use the bash script named ``build_image.sh``.

Don't hesitate to change the actual image's name, which is ``cv-setup``.
